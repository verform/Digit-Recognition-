A supervised logistic regression model,which can predict handwritten digits upto an accuracy of 97.17% .

In this project I have created my own neural network ,which consist three layers : input,hidden and output layer respectively.

I have used **200 hidden nodes** to efficiently train my model.

Also used **learning rate** to **hypertune** my model.
